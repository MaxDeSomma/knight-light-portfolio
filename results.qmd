### Overview
Our project was successful in creating a learning tool for those new to chess. The board would light up the correct available moves when a piece was picked up. It also successfully displayed checks and checkmate when they occurred. Our design was successful in handling pieces capturing other pieces as the game progressed.

### Hardware Results
The board hardware was successful in capturing the positions of the squares with pieces on them. 

### Chess Software Results
100% of the time, the board successfully lit up with the available moves for a piece. The board also displayed checks with 100% accuracy. Since the code for checking check was based on the last picked up and placed down piece's direction, if one side was placed in check and one of its pieces was picked up and placed down, the light to signify check would no longer be lit. The board signified check mate accurately 100% of the time, as long as the pieces were moved one at a time, placed directly over magnet sensors, and in a legal(legal within the rules of chess) fashion. The software was able to successfully ignore erroneous signals from the board. Sometimes, the magnetic field from a piece would set of the sensor of an empty square adjacent to that piece's square, and this was ignored in software by leveraging the fact that a signal of a piece being put down could only occur after a piece was picked up. Because the erroneous signal would signal a put down without a piece being picked up, ensuring a piece was picked up before a put down successfully evaded this error in signal.
